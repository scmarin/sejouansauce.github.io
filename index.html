            <dt>Favorite CMSC Subject:</dt>
            <dd>CMSC 22: It was hard, but making a game has always been a dream of mine since I was a kid.</dd>

            <dt>Favorite GE:</dt>
            <dd>ARTS 1: To be honest, I never really liked GEs since I became used to studying CMSC subjects, but I was able to make an origami that had a pretty emotional bearing to me.</dd>

            <dt>Favorite PL:</dt>
            <dd>Python: The syntax was super beginner-friendly. It was a good starting PL that welcomed me to the curriculum.</dd>

            <dt>Favorite Food:</dt>
            <dd>Bulalo: The savory flavor of the soup and the beef is just amazing.</dd>
            
            <dt>Hobbies:</dt>
            <dd>Playing video games, listening to music, sleeping.</dd>

            <dt>Childhood Dream:</dt>
            <dd>I wanted to become a game developer ever since I was a kid. Unfortunately, even now, I'm not that creative. So I think I'm gearing towards a corporate path.</dd>
